                    Andrew Bloomenthal (2022) defined
                    Electronic Commerce or E-commerce as the
                    online selling and purchasing of goods and
                    services. It can only be done through any
                    smart device (i.e. tablet, smartphone,
                    computer) that can connect to the internet.

                E-commerce uses ICT to support a business' external relationships and interactions with people,
                organizations, and other businesses. According to Kütz (2016), mobile commerce, electronic funds
                transfers, internet marketing, online transaction processing, and automated data collection
                systems are just a handful of the technologies utilized in e-commerce. Most e-commerce uses the
                internet for at least one phase of the transaction's life cycle. To simplify, customers visit a website
                or online store and make purchases using electronic payments. The merchant sends the products
                or renders the service after receiving the payment (Fuscaldo, 2022).

                According to Bloomenthal, the types of E-Commerce can be distinguished by the parties that
                interact through E-Commerce. Each of these has its usage; some are more prominent than
                others.
